I have tried to do a lot of things over the year. I have not mastered any of them really well. Not a big surprise. I first noticed the pattern in 2017. I was in the second year of the graduate school. I realized that I know a little bit of all the trendy things that were going on. A bit of Photoshop, trying my hands on street photography, maintaining a moderate CGPA, interested local and world politics, watch a lot of movies and series', game development, competitive programming made the list. The problem of doing almost all of them parallely in about 2 and a half years is that, I do not know how to do any single of them really well. Because I didn't have the time to dive into the details of street photography or had the time to practice the tricks of input optimization in C++. I realized the problem and did nothing. A year and a half later, while trying to learn Data Science, I noticed the same thing. Although, now the different topic in the same domain is causing the problem. Here's the thing, Data Science hold machine learning, data analysis, and deep learning under its wing. I am trying to learn ML and data analysis for job. Final year thesis needs me to learn Deep Learning. Doing both of them parallely has bad effect on the learning process. But now I do have something of a solution. I will learn as little as deep learning to do the thesis, and after that I will learn ML really well. I am gonna excel at this. In sha Allah.
