# About me
I'm Kuba, a 19-years-old student with interests in GNU/Linux, open source software, programming, cybersecurity and more. I want to share my skills with people and contribute to building a better world.

# About this blog
I post here about my projects or other things which are in my interests. Topics of this blog are mostly related with IT, but I don't want to limit myself, so other content may be here as well :3
