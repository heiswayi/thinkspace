## In short
I am Md Abdur Razzaq Riyadh. A multi-planetary being, learning data science w/ [ISLR](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/). I intend to write notes on each chapter of that book in this blog, which actually turns out is really hard (the blogging part, not the book itself)!

By the way, I am eager to work on data analysis related projects on any field. You can contact me at- **riyadh.razzaq@protonmail.com**
