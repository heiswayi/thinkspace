I am a data scientist in the pharmaceutical industry working with ZS Associates. My primary interests are Machine Learning, Procedural Content Generation, and AI public policy, and blockchains. I take up pro-bono work for NGOs and smart contract development gigs from time to time.
I am also an Amazon Alexa Skills developer with experience in VUI (Voice User Interfaces). 
I've previously worked at [Stylumia Intelligence](https://www.stylumia.ai/), [ZS Associates](https://www.zs.com/), [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/in/) and [EdCaptain](https://edcaptain.com/), A Stealth Mode Startup.
