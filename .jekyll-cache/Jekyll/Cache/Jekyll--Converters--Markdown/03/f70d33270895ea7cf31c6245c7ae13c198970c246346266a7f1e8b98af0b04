<h2 id="what--is-it">What  is it?</h2>

<p><strong>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</strong> - a client / server protocol used to communicate securely across a network by using cryptographic protocols. It prevents eavesdropping or message tampering.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Majority of a TLS connection is related with a TLS handshake. After the TCP connection is established and before any data is sent, the TLS handshake is made.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-cipher-suite">What is a cipher suite?</h3>

<p>It is a string representation of all things that will be done during a handshake, I.e. <strong>TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>TLS - protocol being used</li>
  <li>ECDHE - key exchange method (in this example elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman)</li>
  <li>RSA - authentication mechanism</li>
  <li>AES  - symmetric encryption algorithm</li>
  <li>128 - key size for cipher</li>
  <li>GCM - mode of operation</li>
  <li>SHA256 - hash function that will be used if itâ€™s needed</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Client Hello - It starts a TLS handshake and contains:
    <ul>
      <li>max supported TLS version</li>
      <li>list of Cipher Suites that client supports</li>
      <li>client random, which is large prime number, that makes sure that some attacks are not going to work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Server Hello - It says what will be used in further steps of TLS handshake, meaning
    <ul>
      <li>chosen TLS version</li>
      <li>chosen cipher suite (if there is no matching Cipher Suite found, then it sends an error)</li>
      <li>server random (similar to client random, it is a serverâ€™s own large prime number)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Certificate - It sends an SSL/TLS certificate, that authenticates the server.</li>
  <li>Server Key Exchange - This is an optional message, sends when additional data is required for key exchange method (I.e. Diffie-Hellman)</li>
  <li>Server Hello Done - a message that says that server sent everything, that is required for establishing TLS connection</li>
  <li>Client Key Exchange - It contains clientâ€™s data for key exchange operation</li>
  <li>Change cipher spec message - It says to the server that next message will be encrypted because theyâ€™ve got what they need to encrypt that message.</li>
  <li>Finish - This message is encrypted and allows each party to make sure that the handshake is completed successfully.</li>
  <li>Change cipher spec - A message sent by a server that also communicate that next message will be encrypted</li>
  <li>Finish - encrypted message sent by a server to be verified by a client</li>
</ol>
