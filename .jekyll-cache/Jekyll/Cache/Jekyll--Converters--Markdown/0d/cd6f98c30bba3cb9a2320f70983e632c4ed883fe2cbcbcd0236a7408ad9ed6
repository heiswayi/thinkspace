<p>Google Analytics is a tool that shows its customer how visitors use their website. Although it does not cost any money, it is <strong>NOT</strong> free and open-source software.</p>

<p>Google Analytics may help its customer with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>measuring their website performance</li>
  <li>marketing</li>
  <li>analyzing demography of visitors</li>
  <li>optimizing website pages</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h1>

<p>After signing up and pasting a few lines of JavaScript code into the customer’s website, GA is going to start tracking visitors. This code looks for a _ga cookie (more information below) or if there is no _ga cookie, it creates this, Client ID is sent to Google Analytics servers and then Google shares statistics with Google Analytics’ customer about theirs website.</p>

<h2 id="_ga-cookie">_ga cookie</h2>

<p>This cookie stores your <strong>Client ID</strong>. It stores unique information about user’s browser and device.</p>

<p>Example:
<strong>GA1.2.12349876.1500644855</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>GA - Google Analytics</li>
  <li>1 - version of the cookie format that’s being used. It is fixed</li>
  <li>2 - points a domain where the cookie is set. It represents a number of dots between subdomains and root domains (i.e. example.com = 1, www.example.com = 2)</li>
  <li>12349876 - randomly generated number used for identifying users</li>
  <li>1500644855 - timestamp of when a user first visited a site</li>
</ul>
