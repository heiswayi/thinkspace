I've been hopelessly optimistic blockchain since the start, ever since I came across Monero. The idea of a decentralized censorship-resistant private currency was shocking. Imagine using cash, with the privacy benefits, and without the electronic surveillance. Read more about this [here](https://www.getmonero.org/get-started/what-is-monero/).

Anyway, Monero isn't the point of this post. Apart from private currencies, smart contracts are the next revolutionary thing not only in the field of finance, but also anything that requires trusting a third party. Want to place a bet? Smart contracts. Want to exchange goods without trusting the other party, and without involving a third party? Smart contracts. So when the NFT fad started, I gave into the hype. I wasn't an early adopter by any measure, having started collecting NFTs in 2021, but given the potential of these things, we're all early here.
