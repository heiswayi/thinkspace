I've been hopelessly optimistic blockchain since the start, ever since I came across Monero. The idea of a decentralized censorship-resistant private currency was shocking. Imagine using cash, with the privacy benefits, and without the electronic surveillance. Read more about this [here](https://www.getmonero.org/get-started/what-is-monero/).

Anyway, Monero isn't the point of this post. Apart from private currencies, smart contracts are the next revolutionary thing not only in the field of finance, but also anything that requires trusting a third party. Want to place a bet? Smart contracts. Want to exchange goods without trusting the other party, and without involving a third party? Smart contracts. So when the NFT fad started, I gave into the hype. I wasn't an early adopter by any measure, having started collecting NFTs in 2021, but given the potential of these things, we're all early here. 

## My NFT collection
### [Chunky chickens](https://opensea.io/collection/chunkychickens-v2) 
Number: [#1748](https://opensea.io/assets/0x06c6db12875e254a0e0c7259c7d4993e017edc80/1748) \
Chain: Ethereum \
So the Chunky chicken is the first NFT I bought, primarily due to the team involved. Wizard of Soho, an instagram influencer working in finance, came up with the TendieSwap protocol, a betting platform currently under development with staking, betting across sports, politics, crypto milestones etc. After the success of their initial betting platform, they are coming up with v2, which includes automated bet creation, and a lot more utility! They recently revealed the UI of the new website in their telegram, and it looks bomb!

### [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)
Number: [#1566868](https://opensea.io/assets/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d/1566868) \
Chain: Ethereum \
CryptoKitties need no introduction, a game centered around one of a kind collectible cats, which you can breed to form cats with new and rare traits. It's the original cypto game, with millions of dollars in revenue. Due to high ethereum gas fee, it's slightly impractical to interact with the smart contract currently, but [Dapperlabs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/) the company behind CryptoKitties, and several other award winning projects like [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/), [UFC Collectibles](https://ufc.onflow.org/), and [Cheese Wizards](https://www.cheezewizards.com/), is planning to move the game to the [Flow network](https://www.onflow.org/), which will allow the game to thrive once again!

### [Bit Chicks](https://opensea.io/collection/bitchicks)
Number: [#1748](https://opensea.io/assets/0x44a5c42f43aefa535a964e9b7050e6216b023a7c/1748) \
Chain: Ethereum \
BitChicks is one of the cutest NFTs I own, and it was free! The bitchicks collection was part of an airdrop from the Chunky Chicken collection, an egg that hatched a month after the drop. It's what I plan to use as my tendieswap PFP. It's all part of the tendieverse!
