## P-value
P value is a statistical measure that helps to determine whether or not hypotheses are correct. Usually, if the P value of a data set is below a certain pre-determined amount (like, for instance, 0.05), the "null hypothesis" of an experiment can be rejected.
## $$R^{2}$$-statistic
$$R^2$$ represents the accuracy of the model. It proportion of variance and is independent of yh. 
$$R^2 = (TSS-RSS)/TSS = 1- RSS/TSS$$ 
TSS is the variance in Y before the fit, and RSS is variance after the fit. So TSS-RSS measures the amount of variability in the response that is explained by performing the regression. Variability is the difference between the y and yh.
If R^2 statistic is close to 1, the variability in the reposponse is explained by the model, else it isn't explained and the model is wrong.
## F-statistic
