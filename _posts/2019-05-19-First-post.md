### Hello World!
I've Started this blog so that I can chronicle everything I read, work on, and stuff that I find interesting. I also hope that in order to put up posts everyday, I get some work done. 
I'll mainly be focusing on **Machine Learning**, my work at **ZS**, and general shenanigans.
If you have any suggestions, or interesting topics that you think I should cover, feel free to email me at `gupta.saksham98[at]gmail[dot]com.`
##### Cheers!
