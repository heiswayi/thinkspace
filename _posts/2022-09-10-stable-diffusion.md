I've always wanted to be an architect. Architects for me had superpowers. Imagine putting your thoughts, ideas and dreams onto paper, and watch them unfold from nothing. I carried forward this fascination to graphic design, where I spent hours painstakingly going through pixel by pixel, until a design was ready to be put on paper. I finally settled with data visualization, where I tried to make sense of seemingly random bits of data, to finally exhibit these insights in front of a captive audiance. Until now. 

I recently came across Stable diffusion, a ground breaking machine learning model developed and released by StabilityAI. It is a latent diffusion text to image model trained on images from the LAION-5B database. There are a TOn of exciting things about the model itself, and more about the circumstances around making it open sourse, competition, and the ethics perspective. 

But before I talk about all of this, I just got it setup on my M2 Macbook Air, and want to take it for a spin! Here goes.. \
