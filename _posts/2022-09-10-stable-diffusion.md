I've always wanted to be an architect. Architects for me had superpowers. Imagine putting your thoughts, ideas and dreams onto paper, and watch them unfold from nothing. I carried forward this fascination to graphic design, where I spent hours painstakingly going through pixel by pixel, until a design was ready to be put on paper. I finally settled with data visualization, where I tried to make sense of seemingly random bits of data, to finally exhibit these insights in front of a captive audiance. Until now. 

I recently came across Stable diffusion, a ground breaking machine learning model developed and released by StabilityAI. It is a latent diffusion text to image model trained on images from the LAION-5B database. There are a TON of exciting things about the model itself, and more about the circumstances around making it open sourse, competition, and the ethics perspective. 

But before I talk about all of this, I just got it setup on my M2 Macbook Air, and want to take it for a spin! Here goes.. \

**Shit. Rick Rolled.** \
So there's an inbuilt mechanism that detects if the text you've passed is NSFW, after which it returns this image. I was pretty surprised when a couple of my harmless prompts like '' and '' got flagged, but I was able to reword them and get past this filter. \

 I also got Dall-E access recently, so I thought I'd try pitching SD against DALL-E on some of their famous examples. Somehow, Dall-E images were a lot more *refined*? \

# The Good
### What's so great about this anyway?
We live in magical times! While generative art has been here for a long time, never before has been a tool to create mind blowing art been so easily available. And Free.

# The Bad
### Umm.. Shit. Remember Deepfakes?
Did we just give bad actors the power to create unlimited realistic imagery, which coupled with models which create pages of realistic text on demand can create havoc on an unprecedented level.

# The Ugly
### We're in uncharted territory now.
Where does the law stand on this? Nowhere.
