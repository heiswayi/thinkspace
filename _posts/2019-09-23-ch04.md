# 4.1 An Overview of Classification
Predicting a qualitative response for an observation can be referred to as classifying that observation.
This chapter discusses three classifiers- logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors.
# 4.2 Why Not Linear Regression?
Linear regression for classification on two class produces good result but isn't preferable for more classes.
# 4.3 Logistic Regression
Logistic regression models the *probability* that Y belongs to a particular category. For example, to classify load defaulters (yes or no) given their balance, probability of default given balance will be- 
$$
p(X) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X \tag{1}
$$
